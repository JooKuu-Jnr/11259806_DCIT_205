## Introduction

### Student Details
- Name: Ampah Kuuku Agyensaim
- ID: 11259806


### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a website that showcases relevant information about the computer science department at the University of Ghana. The main goal was to ensure that the website is user-friendly, navigable, and responsive


### Cloning and Setting Up The Website
- To clone this project, navigate to your project folder in your terminal or command prompt and run 'git init' to initialize a new Git repository.
- Fork the repository to your own GitHub account. This creates a personal copy of the original repository under your account.

## Experience

### Challenges
 It was quite a daunting task to build a 10page website in 2 weeks. I realized having surface knowledge about programming languages is entirely different from actually being able to implement it and create something out of it. I kept making errors in my codes, producing wrong outputs of the concepts in my mind half the time I preview my code and to be honest that was quite frustrating. Not to forget the number of hours spent just staring at my Vs Code screen trying to configure where my error was.

### What I Learned
Despite the challenges, I have to admit this project was a lot of fun. I watched many online tutorials and learned so many cool things about HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I discovered how to create neat hover effects, smooth transitions, and stylish page layouts. By the end of the project, I was pleased with what I designed, even though I know there's still a lot more to explore.

One important lesson I've taken from this project is the value of practice and research. I believe these are the keys to becoming a successful student and programmer.
